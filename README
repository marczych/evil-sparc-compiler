To compile the compiler: 'make'

To compile an input program: 'java Evil file.ev'
Note: file.il is the outputted iloc file and file.s is the outputted assembly file

To make an executable: 'gcc -mcpu=v9 file.s -o file'
Note: must be on a Sparc machine

To run executable: './file'


To run benchmarks:

./makeTests.sh - makes the program and runs `java Evil ....ev` on each benchmark (run on vogon/unix)
./runTests.sh - `gcc -mcpu=v9 ....s` on each benchmark, runs the executable and diffs the output (run on sparc)
./runMultiTests.sh - same as runTests.sh except it is multi-threaded
